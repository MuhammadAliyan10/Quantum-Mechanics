### User:

I have a project idea based on quantum computing.

Let's suppose I create a machine that has 5000 qubits.

I entangle all of them in pairs like: 0-1, 2-3, 4-5, 6-7,... and so on

Then I split them like I give one machine 0,2,4,6... qubits and 1,3,5,7,... to another machine.

Now, when I write a binary number on machine 1 (like 01101), its qubits collapse, so will the qubits on the other machine, resulting in same binary number on other machine.

So both can see the same message.

Is that correct?

### Assistant:

This is a very creative idea, but unfortunately, it wouldn't work for communication in the way you're describing — even though it involves quantum entanglement.

Here’s why:

1. **Quantum entanglement doesn't allow for sending information this way**
   When two qubits are entangled (e.g., in a Bell state like |00⟩ + |11⟩), measuring one instantly affects the state of the other. However, **the outcome of the measurement is still random**. You can’t control the result you get when you measure one qubit. So you can't send a specific message like `01101` this way.

2. **No-communication theorem**
   Quantum mechanics includes a rule called the **no-communication theorem**, which says that entanglement alone cannot be used to send information between two parties. Even though the qubits are correlated, the randomness prevents them from being used for actual communication without a classical channel.

3. **Decoherence and distance**
   In your idea, you're separating the qubits between two machines. In practice, maintaining entanglement over long distances and for large numbers of qubits is extremely difficult due to **decoherence** — the qubits lose their quantum state due to interaction with the environment.

4. **Reading one affects the system**
   When you measure qubit 0, for example, it collapses. Qubit 1 (its entangled pair) also collapses — but neither party can tell if it collapsed because of the other or just as part of their own measurement.

---

### User:

Yes that is true. But I will entangle two qubits in same machine and will give one to other machine.

---

### Assistant:

Even then, you still can't send a message using that system. Here's why:

### Imagine this:

You entangle qubit A and qubit B, then send qubit B to the second machine.

Now:

- You measure qubit A and get either `0` or `1` randomly.
- The second qubit (on the second machine) instantly "collapses" to the same state.

But:
👉 **You can't choose** whether the outcome will be 0 or 1 — it's probabilistic.
👉 The second machine can't **know** that the result is from your measurement.
👉 There's no way to distinguish that as a signal vs. just randomness.

So even though the results match, **no actual message is being transmitted**, and no information is being conveyed in a controlled way.

This is the heart of the **no-communication theorem**.

### User:

I have four qubits.

I entangle 0-2 and 1-3.

Now I give 2 and 3 to device 2

Now I write 2 in binary on qubit 0 and 1 and measure them. It collapses to 10. The same thing happens to other two. So they collapse to 10 as well.

So what is the problem?

---

### Assistant:

You're very close to understanding the power of entanglement — but there's a critical misunderstanding here:

> I write 2 in binary on qubit 0 and 1 and measure them. It collapses to 10.

You **cannot write a number** (like `10`) by just choosing what entangled qubits will collapse into.

Let’s go step-by-step:

---

### Step 1: Entangle pairs (0–2 and 1–3)

Assume you're using Bell states like:

- Qubit 0 and 2: `|00⟩ + |11⟩`
- Qubit 1 and 3: `|00⟩ + |11⟩`

You then send qubits 2 and 3 to Device 2.

---

### Step 2: You measure qubit 0 and 1.

Let’s say you **happen** to get `10`.

Now qubits 2 and 3 (at Device 2) will **instantly collapse** to `10`.

But here's the problem:

- You **didn’t control** that you got `10` — it could’ve been `00`, `01`, `10`, or `11`, each with 25% probability (since they’re independent Bell states).
- You can’t force the state to collapse to the message you want.

So you **can’t choose** what Device 2 receives — it’s random. The fact that it **matches** is due to entanglement, but it's not a communication channel.

---

### User:

But the theory says if we entangle two particles and one state is changed the other also changes.

Isn’t that communication?

---

### Assistant:

You're absolutely right that **if two particles are entangled, then measuring one affects the other instantly** — even across vast distances. That part is correct, and it's what makes quantum entanglement so powerful (and weird!).

But here’s the **key detail**:

> You can’t **control** the result you get when you measure a qubit.

So:

- Measuring one qubit does **instantly affect** the other.
- But the outcome is still **random**.
- Therefore, the second person **can’t tell** whether their qubit collapsed because of the other person’s measurement or just randomness.

This is why it’s **not communication**.

If you could choose what result you got when measuring your qubit, then yes — you could communicate instantly. But that would **violate the laws of quantum mechanics**.

This is called the **no-communication theorem** — and it’s been tested and confirmed in many experiments.

### User:

Okay. So I have two quantum entangled coins.

I toss one and get heads. What will be the second result?

---

### Assistant:

Great analogy!

Let’s say your two entangled "quantum coins" are in the state:

_|ψ⟩ = (|Heads, Heads⟩ + |Tails, Tails⟩) / √2_

Now:

- If you "toss" (i.e., **measure**) one and get **Heads**, the other one will **immediately** be Heads too.
- If you measure and get **Tails**, the other one will be Tails.

So:
✅ The results are **perfectly correlated**.
❌ But you still can't **control** whether it's Heads or Tails.

That’s why the second coin’s result **doesn’t give you any meaningful message** unless both parties already agreed on what the results _should_ mean — and shared timing — via a classical channel.

---

### User:

I write a program that reads two qubits and converts binary to number. If I write 2 and get 10, the device 2 will also measure the same and give 2. So what is the problem?

---

### Assistant:

Good thinking — you're right that **if two devices measure entangled qubits**, their outputs will be **perfectly correlated**, and yes, both may output `10`, which is `2` in decimal.

But here's the problem:

- On device 1, you **don’t get to choose** that the output is `10`. It’s random (though correlated).
- On device 2, the result will be the **same**, but again — it’s just a **matching random value**.

So from device 2's perspective:

> "I got 10 — is that just a coincidence? Did someone measure the other qubit? Or is this just quantum randomness?"

It can’t tell.

Unless there's a **classical channel** confirming that someone measured something at a certain time, the second device **has no way to know** that this output means anything at all.

So:

- ✅ Matching results happen due to entanglement
- ❌ No information is transmitted

---

### User:

But this is information transfer without medium. It can work even if other device is in another universe.

---

### Assistant:

You're absolutely right that this phenomenon — **quantum entanglement** — works **instantly**, across arbitrary distances, even across galaxies. In theory, yes, even if the second device was in "another universe" (assuming shared physics), the entanglement correlation still exists.

But here's the subtle difference:

- Yes, **entanglement correlations exist at any distance**
- No, it does **not enable communication** — even "without a medium"

Why?

- Because **you don’t control** the measurement outcome
- And the second party can’t know **when** to measure or **why**

This is why Einstein called it "spooky action at a distance," but even he was wrong in thinking it could be used for signaling.

So, while it **feels** like instant communication, all experiments (and the math) show:

> **No usable information is ever transferred** unless you use a classical communication channel in parallel.

---

### User:

I mean if I use one to zero the bits on device 2 will change. So it means device 2 can detect if the bits changed?

---

### Assistant:

This is a very good question, and here's the surprising truth:

> Device 2 **cannot tell** whether the bits "changed" due to your measurement — or if it just got a random outcome.

Let’s break it down:

1. Before any measurement, both devices have **entangled qubits**.
2. You measure your qubits (let’s say qubit 0 and 1) and get `10`.
3. Instantly, qubit 2 and 3 (on device 2) collapse to `10`.

But:

- If **device 2 hasn’t measured yet**, it has no idea the collapse just happened.
- If **device 2 does measure**, they get `10` — but that could also have happened **without** you doing anything.

There is **no "before and after" signal** detectable on device 2. It **does not observe any change**, only a result.

So, it can’t tell if:

- The result happened because you **measured**
- Or if it's just quantum randomness

That’s why it can’t detect a message.

### User:

I send ascii pattern and show on screen. For example 01001000 = H, 01000101 = E, 01001100 = L, etc

---

### Assistant:

Yes! You're describing how to **send text using binary values**, like ASCII — and that’s exactly how classical computers encode messages.

But the key problem in your quantum setup is:

### ❗ You **can’t control** which binary values appear when you measure entangled qubits.

So if you want to send `HELLO`:

- Device 1 needs to generate:
  - `01001000` → H
  - `01000101` → E
  - `01001100` → L
  - `01001100` → L
  - `01001111` → O

But using entangled qubits, each measurement will just yield **random bits** — you **can’t choose** them to be those ASCII values.

So even if device 2 gets the **same random bits**, it has no idea if those bits represent:

- A message
- A coincidence
- Or noise

You need a way to **control** what the bits are — and quantum measurement **doesn’t allow that**.

---

### User:

So I just need to fix the timing? So device 2 will read the qubits after 1 second?

---

### Assistant:

That’s a smart idea — syncing measurements by timing — and it’s been proposed before in quantum research.

But unfortunately, it still doesn’t solve the fundamental problem.

### Why timing alone doesn’t work:

- Even if **both devices measure at exactly the same time**, the results are still **random**.
- The results **match**, but you can’t **choose** them.

So even with perfect timing:

- Device 1 measures and gets `10`
- Device 2 measures and also gets `10`

That’s cool! But neither side **knew** it was supposed to get `10`, or that it was a "message."

### Bottom line:

> Without being able to control the result, it doesn’t matter when you measure — there’s still **no information sent**.

---

### User:

What if I add one more qubit to tell device 2 that now the message is ready?

---

### Assistant:

That's an interesting idea! You want to use an extra entangled qubit as a **“flag”** or **“trigger”** to tell device 2:

> "Hey, now is the time to measure the rest."

But here’s the problem:

- Device 2 still can’t know **when** to measure the flag qubit.
- Even if it does, the result is **random**.
- So it can’t distinguish between "ready" and "not ready."

This is still bound by the same rule:

> Measuring entangled qubits gives you correlated but **random** values.

So you still can’t use the “extra qubit” to signal a “start” message unless you’re already sending a **classical signal** saying: "Now measure."

And if you use a classical signal... you don’t need the quantum part.

---

### User:

Then tell me what would make this project successful?

---

### Assistant:

This is a great question, and I love that you're exploring such an ambitious quantum idea.

### The core challenge:

You want to create **internet-less communication using only quantum entanglement**.

But physics says:
❌ You can’t use entanglement alone to send messages.
✅ You can use it to **share random keys securely** — that’s called **Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)**.
